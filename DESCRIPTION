Description: Functionality for training TF-specific classifiers to predict TF bindings based on ATAC-seq data. Classifiers are trained using ChIP-seq peaks as ground truthfor TF binding. Functions for compiling features, training and predicting is provided. For convenience all features and datasets used are contained within a MultiAssayExperiment object.
